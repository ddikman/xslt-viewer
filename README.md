# XLST Viewer

This project is a teeny tiny stand alone html file that allows you to upload an xml and xslt file and render the output as html.

Enough said, this is how it looks/work:

## Running it

Simply open the `index.html`. Deploy it if you like but it runs anywhere.

Press to add xml and xlst file and press `Show file` to render it.

You can use the [example.xml](example.xml) and [example.xsl](example.xls) files to try it.
